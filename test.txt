Hello world! 

You may find yourself living in another part of the world
You may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
You may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself: "well, how did I get here?"

Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
In to the blue again, after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
